How'd you get into this,
Drummond?

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,560
I got recruited
out of law school,
wide-eyed and bushy-tailed.

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,440
You know, life of adventure,
exciting folks,
exotic locales...

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,640
Been exotic?

5
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,840
Huh! Only exotic
I've seen is the bugs
in my intestinal tract.

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,800
Gives a new meaning
to the term
"liquefied assets."

00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,400
Slow down, Henry. I'd like
to have all my limbs get there
at the same time.

Can't slow down,
can't get out.
